# WExT Examples #

### Description ###
Here we provide simple examples of running WExT on simulated data for demonstration purposes.

### Usage ###
Each example has its own directory and Makefile.

### Examples ###

Currently, we only have an example for running WExT on Pan-Cancer data in `pancan`.  For more examples, see [our files for reproducing the experiments in the ECCB/Bioinformatics paper](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/tree/master/experiments/eccb2016).
